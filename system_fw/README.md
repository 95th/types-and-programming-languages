I've included some selected references on implementing System Fw, particularly with respect to the addition of recursive types (System F omega-mu):

-  Mendler, N.P.: Recursive types and type constraints in second-order lambda calculus. In: Proceedings of the Second Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer
Science, Ithaca, N.Y., IEEE Computer Society Press (1987) 30–36

   - One of the classic, highly reference papers


- Andreas Abel, Ralph Matthes, Tarmo Uustalu, "Iteration and coiteration schemes for higher-order and nested datatypes", Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 333, Issues 1–2, 2005, Pages 3-66,

   - Interesting implementations, a paper that allowed me to better understand "Mendler iterations"

- Andreas Abel, Ralph Matthes, "Fixed Points of Type Constructors and Primitive Recursion", International Workshop on Computer Science Logic (2004)

- Ahn, Ki Yung, "The Nax Language: Unifying Functional Programming and Logical Reasoning in a Language based on Mendler-style
Recursion Schemes and Term-indexed Types" (2014). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 2088.

   - This reference is quite useful as it restates much of the literature in easily understandable terms

- Yufei Cai, Paolo G. Giarrusso, and Klaus Ostermann. 2016. System f-omega with equirecursive types for datatype-generic programming. SIGPLAN Not. 51, 1 (January 2016), 30-43. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/2914770.2837660

   - Interesting, but I found it to be of not too much practical use
